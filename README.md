# ATM-Networks
There are many switching techniques used by telecommunication networks and Asynchronous Transfer Mode is one of the renowned switching technique that uses asynchronous time-division multiplexing for encoding all the data into equal-sized, small cells. This technique is different from Ethernet or internet that uses variable packet sizes or data or frames. Out of all the renowned protocols, the ATM is a best fit because it is used over SONET backbone of the Integrated Digital Service Network(ISDN). Typically, this is a high-speed network standard which is frame worked in such a way that it can support voice, video and data communications, and to enhance the utilization and quality of Service (QoS) on high-traffic networks.

ATM is generally utilized by the internet service providers inside their private long-distance network. This operates in the second layer of OSI model, which is data link layer, over either twisted-pair or fibre optics cable. Thus, the ATM provides data link layer services which run on the first layer of OSI i.e. physical links. The functionality is quite similar to the small-packet switched and circuit-switched network. That will make it perfect for real-time, low latency data such as VoIP and video, as well as for high-throughput data traffic for file transferring. A virtual circuit or connection has to be installed before the data exchange between the two points take place.
